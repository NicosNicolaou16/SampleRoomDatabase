# Sample Room Database

This is a sample project that uses room database to present dummy data on a recycler view using data
binding. <br />

# The Project Contain the following technologies

The programming language is the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html), it is a
modern, JVM-based programming language that is concise, safe, and interoperable with Java. <br />
[Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) is used for asynchronous
tasks. <br />
[Kotlin KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) is a collection of Kotlin extensions that
offer more concise and expressive code for working with Android APIs and libraries.
[Room Database](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) is responsible for saving
the retrieved data from the remote server, querying data from the local database, and supporting
offline functionality.  <br />
[Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) in Android lets you link
UI components to data directly in the XML layout. It automatically updates the UI when the data
changes, reducing the need for manual coding and making the app easier to maintain. <br />
[View Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) in Android is a feature
that automatically generates a binding class for each layout, providing direct access to the views
without using `findViewById()`. It ensures safer, type-checked code by reducing the risk of errors
like `NullPointerException`, making the code simpler and more maintainable. <br />
Navigation <br />
Live Data <br />
MVVM <br />
[KSP](https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-ksp) ("Kotlin Symbol Processing") is a tool for
efficient annotation processing in Kotlin, providing faster code generation and symbol manipulation
compared to KAPT. [Repository](https://github.com/google/ksp) <br />
[R8](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code) enabled, is a code shrinker and obfuscator for
Android that optimizes and reduces the size of APKs by removing unused code and resources, while
also obfuscating the remaining code to improve security. <br />
